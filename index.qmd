## Format Notes

Due to formatting constraints, some portions of the web-based materials are not available in the PDF version (i.e., R code). Additionally, tables and images may appear out of order. We've done our best to provide reference links and documentation when this occurs. However, for the best experience, please refer to the [web-based version](https://apelakh.github.io/pelakh-et-al-2025-supplement/) of this Quarto book.
